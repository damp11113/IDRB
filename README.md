# IDRB (Internet Digital Radio Broadcasting) System
IDRB is a novel internet radio broadcasting alternative that uses HLS/DASH/HTTP streams, transferring over TCP/IP. This system supports images and RDS (Dynamic update) capabilities, enabling the transmission of station information. Additionally, it allows for setting station logos and images. IDRB offers multi-broadcasting functionalities and currently supports the Opus codec, with plans to incorporate PCM, MP2/3, AAC/AAC+, and more in the future, ensuring low delay. If you find this project intriguing.
